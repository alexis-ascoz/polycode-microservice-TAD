== Fonctionnal quarters

To start with the microservices architecture, it is necessary to define the functional quarters of the application, to initiate a first separation of the application into microservices. A functionnal quarter is define by a set of user stories.

=== User story vocabulary

The following table contains the vocabulary of PolyCode. He is used to describe the user stories in the next section.

Guest:: Someone who doesn't have a PolyCode account.

User:: Someone who has a PolyCode account.

Module:: A coherent set of module and contents, organized in a tree structure. A module can be a challenge, a practice, a certification, a submodule, a test, etc.

Content:: A coherent set of components, organized in a tree structure. It's a branch of the tree that are the modules. A content can be an exercice, a lesson, a question, etc.

Component:: A coherent set of components, organized in a tree structure. It's a branch or a leave of another branch that are the contents or the components. A component can be an code editor, a quizz, a markdown, a mcq, a container, etc.

Test:: A type of module. He is made to evaluate users. It has a grade, which is the average of the grades of all contents of the test.

Assessment:: A section of PolyCode made to evaluate users, by passing tests.

Campaign:: The realization of an assessment in a set of users. 

Candidate:: Someone who is invited to participate to a campaign. Became an user if he accepts the invitation.

Assessment creator:: A user who can create an test or an assessment, then invite someone to participate to it, as a candidate.

Practice creator:: A user who can manage his modules.

Submitable:: A component that can be submitted by the user. It can be a code editor, a quizz, a mcq, etc.

Validator:: The excepted response to a submitable.

Submission:: A user answer to a submitable. It is verified by a set of validators.

Tag:: A keyword that can be associated to a content, a candidate, etc.

Item:: A purchasable object. It can be a hint, a validator, etc.

Purchase:: The action of buying an item.

Hint:: A type of item that gives a clue to the user to solve a component. It is bought with polypoints.

Polypoints:: A virtual money responsible of the gamification of PolyCode. It can be used to buy items, like hints. It also used to rank users. The polypoints are collected by the users by passing modules and contents.

Team:: A group of users. The team polypoints are the sum of the polypoints of all users of the team, and is used to rank the teams.

Captain:: A user who can manage his team.

=== User stories

The following tables contains the most of the user stories of PolyCode. It is not exhaustive, but it contains the most important user stories.
She is organized by functional quarters.

=== PolyCode microservices architecture

Below is a proposed architecture for PolyCode microservices.

.PolyCode microservice architecture schema
image::images/PolyCode microservice architecture schema.png[]

The main application will be detached into several microservices. This proposal is made of five microservices, themselves made of several modules. In the future, each microservice module may be detached into a new microservice.

For now, the five microservices are:

- `Authentication` (Keycloak): This microservice will be used for all PolyCode users and services authentication.
- `Account`: This microservice will be used for all PolyCode users and services account management, including the user profile, the user preferences, the user teams, etc. It also used to manage the user's transactions (shop). For now, this microservice will aslo do the authorization part, because it is already implemented.
- `Mailer`: This microservice will be used to send emails to users.
- `Learning`: This microservice will be used to manage the learning part of PolyCode, including the campaigns, the tests, the contents, the modules, the submitables, the validators, etc. It also used to get statistics about the assessments part.
- `Runner`: This microservice will be used to run the user's code and return standard output and standard error.

In a first time, we will only detach the authentication microservice from the main application. The other microservices will be detached later.
The authorization part will be migrated to the authentication microservice in a second time.
